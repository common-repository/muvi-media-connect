### How to add and edit a shortcode for content?
 You can edit the shortcode by yourself by following the below process.

 * When we add Single/Multipart content(AOD/VOD) from Muvi media, it generates a shortcode automatically.
 * For VOD/AOD Single Part Content: Shortcode: [muvimedia permalink=’cat’ height=’315′ width=’560′] where muvimedia is the name of the shortcode which will be constant.

 Permalink is a mandatory parameter that we will get from Muvi CMS. You need to go to manage content > content library > edit any content > permalink.

 The height is the content height which is visible in the video and audio player when the content is played. The height is by default 315, but you can edit it as per your requirement.

 Similarly, width is the content width which is by default 650, but you can edit it as per your requirement.
